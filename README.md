# socket

#It is simple socket programming. 

#'echo_server.c' and 'echo_client.c' are codes that only server can send string to client.
#After you compile it, you can run it with commands './echo_server PORT' and './echo_client 127.0.0.1 PORT'.

#'chat_server.c' and 'chat_client.c' are codes that server and client can send string to each other in turn, not at the same time.
#(Use thread, for enabling at the same time.)
